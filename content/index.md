# Hello, world!

This is the [[digital garden]] of Dr. Michael Lesniak -- a place where I shape, collect and present my thoughts, [lessons learned](/tag-lessonslearned.html), short code snippets, links, read books, concepts and interesting musings.

See [[now]] for all (technical and intellectual) topics which are currently on my mind.
