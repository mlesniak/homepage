# Hello, world!

This is the [[digital garden]] of Dr. Michael Lesniak -- a place where I shape, collect and present my thoughts, [lessons learned](/tag-lessonslearned.html), short code snippets, links, read books, concepts and interesting musings. You can find all content as raw markdown on the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/mlesniak/homepage). The shown HTML is generated by a [simple go program](https://github.com/mlesniak/homepage/blob/master/main.go)

See [[now]] for all (technical and intellectual) topics which are currently on my mind.

## Projects

Besides writing (technical) articels I'm a software engineer by heart. Over the years I've developed a few projects in various languages which are hosted on GitHub. In the following I'll describe some of them.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is one of the **most famous programming challenges** on the internet, designed and hosted by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Starting on the first of December each day a new problem is posted on the website and you can only advance to the next problem if you've actually solved the previous day correctly. While the first day's problem is usually solved by around 85.000 users, the last and final problem is only solved by ca. 2.500 users. I first participated in 2019 and the problems ranged from writing a virtual CPU, simulating a network of aforementioned CPUs, implementing path finding algorithms for painting robots on the hull of a space ship, simulating recursive cellular automates, finding cycles in gravitational oribts, implementing a perfect breakout player to computing chemical equations etc. My hacky and whacky solutions to all problems can be found in the [corresponding GitHub repository](https://github.com/mlesniak/advent-of-code-2019). The repository also has a very brief description of each day's problem.

**Writing a raytracer** is one of the most satisfying projects you can work on as a developer. The [necessary math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics) can be understood in an afternoon and the amount of supporting literature is vast. For all mathemtical backgrounds I recommend the book series [_Raytracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io). The source code for the raytracer I wrote is obviously in the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/mlesniak/go-raytracer); it supports (among other things) different materials and refractions, e.g. it allows to produce images such as
