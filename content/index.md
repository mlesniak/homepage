# Hello, world!

This is the [[digital garden]] of Dr. Michael Lesniak -- a place where I shape, collect and present my thoughts, [lessons learned](/tag-lessonslearned.html), short code snippets, links, read books, concepts and interesting musings. You can find all content as raw markdown on the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/mlesniak/homepage). The shown HTML is generated by a [simple go program](https://github.com/mlesniak/homepage/blob/master/main.go)

See [[now]] for all (technical and intellectual) topics which are currently on my mind.

## Projects

Besides writing (technical) articels I'm a software engineer by hear. Over the years I've developed a few projects in various languages which are hosted on GitHub. In the following I'll describe some of them.
