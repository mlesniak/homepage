# My Principles

https://dominikbraun.io

Over the past years, I've discovered some principles and approaches that helped me increase the reliability and maintainability of software. Whenever I'm writing code, I strongly attach importance to these principles.

Build often, build early. Release often, release early.
Prefer »simple«, avoid »clever«.
If »clever« can't be avoided, it has to be tested and well-documented.
YAGNI: Don't implement it if you haven't been asked for it.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
