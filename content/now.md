Based on the tradition of [now](https://nownownow.com/about)-pages, these are the topics I'm currently focusing on

- Learning basic OpenGL programming using Go
- Playing [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/)
- After learning to solve a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube), trying to improve my time. 
- Learning about procedural generation and thinking about ideas how to apply this.
