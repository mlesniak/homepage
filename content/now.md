Based on the tradition of [now](https://nownownow.com/about)-pages, these are the topics I'm currently focusing on

- Reading [Dune](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717) (as a preparation for the movie)
- After learning to solve a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube), trying to improve my time. 
- Learning about procedural generation.
